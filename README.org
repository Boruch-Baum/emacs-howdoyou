* Intro
This package is inspired by howdoi python and howdoi Emacs packages. it searches
your query all across stackoverflow and it's sisters' sites. They are:
- stackoverflow.com
- stackexchange.com 
- superuser.com
- serverfault.com
- askubuntu.com

The result is then showed in an ~org-mode~ buffer. For each result, question and
three answers were showed, but they are collapsed by default except the first
answer. As this package uses Google to get the links, for each query there will
be a dozen of links, the fist link will be used, then users can go to next
link and previous link. The author believes that when searching for solutions it
is important for users to read both questions and answers, so no "quick look"
features such as code only view or code completion are provided.
* Install
MELPA

[[https://melpa.org/#/howdoyou][file:https://melpa.org/packages/howdoyou-badge.svg]]

Spacemacs layer:

https://github.com/thanhvg/spacemacs-eos

* Dependencies
~promise~ and ~request~ are required.
User must have ~org-mode~ 9.2 or later installed also.

* Commands
- ~howdoyou-query:~                 prompt for query and do search
- ~howdoyou-next-link:~             go to next link
- ~howdoyou-previous-link:~         go to previous link
- ~howdoyou-go-back-to-first-link:~ go back to first link
- ~howdoyou-reload-link:~           reload link

* Use with helm-google-suggest
add this snippet to you config file
#+begin_src elisp
  (with-eval-after-load "helm-net"
    (push (cons "How Do You"  (lambda (candidate) (howdoyou-query candidate)))
          helm-google-suggest-actions))
#+end_src
Now =helm-google-suggest= will pass suggestion to howdoyou-query as default
action.

Note that =spacemas-eos= has its own faster google suggetion engine provided by
[[https://github.com/thanhvg/emacs-google-suggest][google-suggest]] package.

* Use with counsel-web-suggest
Requires installed and configured 3rd party package [[https://github.com/mnewt/counsel-web][counsel-web]].

add this function definition to your config file
#+begin_src elisp
  (defun my/howdoyou-with-suggestions ()
    "Call `howdoyou-query' with suggestions from `counsel-web-suggest'."
    (interactive)
    (counsel-web-suggest nil
                        "How Do You: "
                        #'counsel-web-suggest--google
                        (lambda (x)
                          (howdoyou-query x))))
#+end_src
Now when calling =my/howdoyou-with-suggestion= (either from ~M-x~ or by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Changing-Key-Bindings.html][key binding]] of your choice)
it will pass =counsel-web-suggest= suggestions to howdoyou-query.
